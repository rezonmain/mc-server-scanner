# Public minecraft server scanner

It uses [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) and [dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/) to scan for public minecraft servers on default port `25556`.

# How does it work

`ip_range.py` provides a class with utility functions to generate a file of ip ranges with either an /8 or /16 CIDR range. \
The scanner script chooses a random ip address range from this file and calls `masscan` with it, on scan end, it queues a server list ping that on success writes the response to a MongoDB database.

# Installation and configuring

Install docker compose: [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [CentOs / Oracle linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)

Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/rezonmain/mc-server-scanner.git
    cd mc-server-scanner

To enable saving found servers to a db, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the root directory

     cp .env.example .env

Edit the `MONGO_URI` environment variable to your connection string. You can create a free MongoDB cluster with [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)

# Rate limiting masscan

Running masscan on a home network unlimited will **melt** your router, in my case, I run it at 35,000 kp/s which scans a x.x.x.x/16 range (65,536 hosts) in ~2 seconds, and at 100,000 kp/s when scanner is running on a vm.

To edit the rate at which masscan runs, edit the RATE environment variable in `.env`

    MONGO_URI=MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<mongourl>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
    RATE=100000 <- set to your liking
    IDENT=SERVER_NAME

Run docker compose up

    sudo docker compose up
